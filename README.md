# Weather API
In this project we worked as an agile team using a scrumboard with daily standups to better plan and cooperate. 
The main priority of this project was to work in a way that fits test-driven development standards and to use a CI/CD pipeline to test and deploy our work in a more fluid way.
We also heavily used branches for all the different features we developed, and had code-reviews with at least two of the team members per pull request.

<h3>The application</h3>

We built an API with different endpoints to either get weather data about different cities, healthchecking and to see how many calls have been made since the API first started.

## Getting started
### Prerequisities
You need to have .NET installed on your computer, which can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download "here").
Other than that you also need to make sure you have installed npm.
`npm install npm@latest -g`
### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/Chrisvasa/FoxWeatherApp.git`
2. Either launch the application through an IDE or build the project and then launch it using an EXE.
3. To further interact with the API you can open the `WeatherAppReactClient` folder in VSCode and type the following commands which should be enough to get you started.
`npm i`
`npm run dev`
Then either press `o` or click the link that shows up.
### Usage
The demo below shows how you can interact and retrieve weather data, favorite cities and remove favorites.
